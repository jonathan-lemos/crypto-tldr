# NFT's

At a high level, an NFT (non-fungible token) is a *distinct* virtual "thing" that can be bought and sold.
This is opposed to a "fungible token" i.e. currency, where each token is identical to any other token of its kind.
A vast majority of NFT's are just hyperlinks to images, but they can theoretically be much more than that.


## How do they work?

NFT's on Ethereum are implemented as a smart contract (basically a service that runs on the blockchain) that has the following traits:

1. It keeps track of which token ID is owned by which address and vice versa.
    * A token ID is technically just a number, and by extension, an NFT is technically just a number that the contract says belongs to an address.
    * For developers, think of this part as a `HashMap<int, address>` and a `HashMap<address, int[]>`.
2. It allows you (or a third party that you approve e.g. OpenSea) to transfer your token ID to another address.
3. It has a function that takes in a token ID and returns a link to that NFT's metadata (image link, attributes, etc.).
    * For developers, this function takes an `int` and returns a JSON `string`.

## How do I make money off this?

**TL;DR: You don't**

If you're looking for a guaranteed method to get rich quick with minimal effort off NFT's, keep looking.
