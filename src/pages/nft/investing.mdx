# "Investing" in NFT's

*This should go without saying, but I'm a software developer, not a financial advisor.
Any money you lose by following this advice is your own fault.*

At a high-level, you should view NFT's similarly to real-world collectibles.
Occasionally, you get a collectible that skyrockets in value like Action Comics #1.
Most of the time, you have a bunch of losers telling you that you'll retire at 30 if you <a href="https://www.today.com/home/your-beanie-baby-collection-actually-worth-lot-money-now-t141597" target="_blank">buy a bunch of Beanie Babies</a>.
The real winner of the Beanie Baby craze (NFT's in the 90s) was the company selling them.
If you want to go that route, <Link to="/nft/creating">here's how</Link>.

Generally speaking, you shouldn't view NFT's as an investment just like you don't view Happy Meal toys as an investment (honestly, a Happy Meal toy is worth more than your average NFT these days).
If you want an investment that appreciates over time, try the stock market.
You will get a fairly reliable 10%/year (average) that's been backed by 100 years of history.

If that's not good enough for you and you want to 10x your money in 3 days, hit a roulette table.
Your odds will honestly be better in Vegas than with NFT's.

**If there's any one thing to take away from this article**, it's that "rich" means "wealthier than the average person".
Therefore, the average person, by definition, cannot be rich.
So if you see anyone promising to make "everyone rich", you can be 100% sure that they're a scammer or ill-informed.

## How they're valued

NFT prices are determined by a free market.
As such, an NFT is ultimately worth what buyers are willing to pay for it and what sellers are willing to sell it for.

To get a bird's eye view over the entire NFT market, we can determine the *average* price of an NFT with
$$
\frac{total price of all NFTs}{total amount of NFTs}
$$

The problem is that the $total amount of NFTs$ is rapidly increasing because anyone can create any amount of them, but there's a limited amount of ETH to spread between them.
This means that as time goes on, the average price of an NFT approaches 0, because any finite number divided by infinity is 0.
As such, it is unwise to hold on to *average* NFT's as an "investment", as you will almost certainly lose your entire principal over time.

### So why did they initially shoot up in value?

The initial parabolic rise in NFT prices was due to a FOMO (fear of missing out) cycle.
In a healthy free market, the demand for a good drops as the price rises.
For example, you would buy the latest iPhone for $500, but not for $3000.
This concept keeps prices from shooting off into space, because if they get too high, people won't pay them.

In a FOMO cycle, the opposite is true; as the price rises, the demand also rises and vice versa.
An example of this concept is the housing market pre-2008.
You didn't buy a second house because you wanted to live in it or because you thought it was a good value,
you bought a second house because your neighbor Fred just quit his job after becoming a millionaire off the 6 houses he owns,
and you know that you're smarter than Fred, but he's making more money than you for less effort.
So you end up buying a second house not because of any logical reasoning, but because you want to get on the gravy train with everyone else.

The problem with these cycles is that eventually they run out of money to sustain the parabolic increase in prices, and prices plummet because the sky-high valuations were only possible because of the FOMO.

## Identifying an above-average NFT

Like physical collectables, the average NFT becomes worthless over time, but there will inevitably be a few that rise to the top and actually retain some kind of value long-term.
The ones that beat the odds have some form of value that sets them apart from an average NFT, such as

1. They're historically significant (rare Pokemon cards). People like to own goods that shaped history even if they're intrinsically worthless without the historical context.
2. They're status symbols (Supreme clothing). People will pay ridiculous amounts to convince themselves that they're special.
3. They have actual intrinsic value (OSRS Twisted Bow). This one's self-explanatory; people buy goods that are useful to them in their lives.

A simple litmus test to identify if an NFT is actually worth something is to ask yourself if you'd buy it *as-is* (not including any promises made by the team) at its current price even if you could never sell it.
If the answer is "no", you shouldn't buy it.

But whatever you do, **do not buy NFT's at mint**. If you do, you're asking to get rugged.

## Rug pulls

A "rug pull" is where a NFT team promises a bunch of future development on a project, collects people's money, and then disappears without delivering anything.
Most NFT projects end up getting rugged because, frankly, the community encourages it.
They throw a bunch of money at these NFT teams in advance and then expect the team to do a bunch of work for no additional money, when the team has no legal obligation to do so.
Then the community complains about getting rugged before they FOMO into yet another project and get the same result.

I don't believe most teams create the project intending to rug, but it happens anyway through the following process (I personally have experienced this twice):

1. Get together with some people over Discord to launch an NFT.
2. The "PR guy" makes a bunch of promises to get people interested in the project.
3. The developer puts in crazy hours to make everything work.
4. The team launches the project and it sells out.
5. The team relaxes once they've gotten their money, they want to buy some things, take a little break, and come back to finish it.
6. When the team comes back after a few days or so, the price has plummeted to half the mint price (if they're lucky).
7. They start to deliver, but the OpenSea royalties have dried up because the price is so low. Meanwhile, people are constantly complaining about the price.
    a. Some of the promises made might not be possible from a technical standpoint.
8. The developer takes time off the project and because nobody on the team has actual professional management experience, they fail to find a replacement and the project stalls.
9. The floor price of the NFT reaches 0.
10. The team decides to rug the project because there's nothing they can do to save the price anymore, and they would have to spend several hours and pay several thousand dollars to deploy the new features just to get nothing in return.

From the buyer's perspective, the process looks something like this:

1. 🚀🚀 WAGMI 🚀🚀 THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO THE MOON
2. I NEED WHITELIST (Spoiler: everyone gets whitelisted. It's just smoke and mirrors to try to convince you that giving away your money is somehow a privilege.)
3. WE SOLD OUT!!!!!!!
4. I can't believe all these paper hands selling for below mint price. Sweep the floor!
5. I can't believe all these paper hands selling the rare ones for below mint price. Sweep the floor!
6. Floor price is 0. Can devs do something?
7. It's rugged, guys
8. Go to another project to do the same thing.

I don't understand why NFT buyers expect a bunch of recently-rich kids on Discord to act like George Washington.
